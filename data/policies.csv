Pause New Water Right Applications,"Suspend all new water rights applications in the Great Salt Lake basin, as implemented by Gov. Spencer Cox in November 2022.",total_consumptive_use,absolute,0.000987,0,0,False,,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2022/11/11/gov-cox-has-put-new-water-rights/,Took figure 4000AF/5 years and withdrew that from total consumption
Turf Conversion,Replace turf grass with local plants that require less water.,landscaping_consumption,absolute,0.105,298000000,0,True,Linear,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/3/214/htm,Unsure about trustworthness of numbers. Taken for northern Utah
Install Secondary Meters,There are approximately a quarter million unmetered connections in Utah. Installing water meters on these connections would enable consumers to understand their water use. Water meters also allow water suppliers to charge by usage. House bill HB242 aims to install secondary meters. ,municipal_consumption,absolute,0.207,250000000,0,True,Linear,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2022/02/22/why-era-cheap-water-may/,Includes houses not in N Utah
Limit US Magnesium's Water Usage,US Magnesium produces magnesium by drawing water from the GSL and evaoprating the water to concentrate magnesium chloride salts. The company is planning to deepen their canal connecting to the lake so that they can continue to draw water at lower lake levels.,mineral_consumption,absolute,0.23,0,1130000000,True,Linear,"Wurtsbaugh et al, https://documents.deq.utah.gov/water-quality/standards-technical-services/great-salt-lake-advisory-council/Activities/DWQ-2012-006863.pdf",Preventing the canal construction would only have an impact at lower lake levels
Pipe Water Canals,Canals carry water throughout and between fields. Installing water impermeable lining into a canal reduces the amount of water that seeps into the soil. ,agricultural_consumption,absolute,0.257,15400000,0,True,Linear,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/3/214/htm,Northern Utah. Questionable numbers 
Enable Water Banking,"Water banking allows water rights holders to lease their water to others without losing their rights . During wet years, excess water could be bought to benefit the lake.",agricultural_consumption,absolute,0.0657,0,1063000,True,Linear,https://www.perc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PPR-Water-Markets-220916-WEB.pdf#page=29,"$20/AF assumed. Only for Cache Valley. Paying to lease additional water may increase the number of farmers willing to sell additional water, because it would incentivize conservation. Averaged over 1990-2020."
Buy Water Rights,"Purchase water rights for the lake. Water rigths likely follow an upward sloping supply curve, such that they become more expensive for each right purchased.  This slider estimates a flat price of $5,000 per acre foot, which is higher then the current  price but lower then potential future  prices.",agricultural_consumption,absolute,0.05,200000000,0,True,Linear,,Whack!
Pay Farmers to Not Grow Alfalfa,"Alfalfa and other hays are consume 70% of  Utah's water, while generating 0.2% of the states economic output. This policy simulates the state directly paying farmers to not grow hay. ",alfalfa_consumption,absolute,0.7,0,242000000,True,Linear,hay gdp contribution: https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~lozada/Research/UtahAgWaterUseHay.docx hay consumptive use: Wurtsbaugh et al,
Replace Flood Irrigation with Sprinklers,Flood irrigation is significantly less water efficient per acre then irrigating with sprinklers. Significant water can be saved by transitioning to sprinkler irrigation without effecting farmer productivity.,agricultural_consumption,absolute,0.15,20822140,0,True,Linear,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/3/214/htm,
Improve Irrigation Scheduling,Studies conducted in California show that improved irrigation scheduling can reduce water use by around 15%. This policy simulates investing in irrigation scheduling technologies.,agricultural_consumption,absolute,0.18,22917200,0,True,Linear,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/3/214/htm,This seems wrongï¿½. why does it cost so much? How does it save so much water?
