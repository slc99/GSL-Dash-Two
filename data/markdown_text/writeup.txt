### Introduction

The Great Salt Lake is drying up. The effects of this are disastrous and wide-ranging. While climate change and the ongoing drought are partially responsible for the current water level, human water consumption is the driving factor behind the lake's decline. Therefore, policy decisions and individual actions can save the lake. There is an ongoing debate about which policies should be pursued to help the Great Salt Lake, from optimizing agricultural production to xeriscaping yards. I was curious about the relative impact and cost-effectiveness of different policies, so I created this tool.

The aim of this tool is two-fold. First, this tool illustrates the effect different policy proposals will have on the lake's water level. Second, this tool estimates the ecological, monetary, and health impacts of the predicted lake level. To do this, I built a model of the Great Salt Lake. The model works by calculating the total water that enters the lake through rivers, groundwater, and direct precipitation, and the total water that leaves the lake through evaporation.

### About the Policies

For this tool, I used a variety of published predictions about the effective impact of different policies. Details for each policy are below:

- **Pause New Water Rights Applications:** Predicted effects are based on the estimates found in the Salt Lake Tribune article "Gov. Cox put new water rights on hold. Will it actually help the Great Salt Lake?", which states that "the Division of Water Rights has only approved about 4,000 acre-feet of new diversions in the Great Salt Lake basin over the last five years". This effect is extrapolated for the entire prediction time window, assuming 100% of approved diversions are consumed. This method overestimates the effects of the policy, as a portion of water diversions are not consumed. 
- **Install Secondary Meters:** Water saved per connection was calculated from a sample of 5,000 Uintah Bench residents based on "Secondary Metering White Paper 2022-02-14". Total savings were calculated by multiplying per household savings with the estimated 221,000 unmetered connections targeted by HB242. The cost of the policy, \$250 million, was set by the funds allocated in HB242. This overestimates the effect of the policy because a portion of the unmetered connections are outside the Great Salt Lake basin. However, future water price increases may further reduce the water consumption of metered connections. Because the relative magnitude of these effects are hard to quantify, I decided to leave the impact unadjusted. 
- **Limit Mineral Water Usage:** Total water consumption of US Magnesium and other mineral companies was found from data published in "Decline of the world's saline lakes". Estimates for the total economic output of mineral industries were found in "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake" prepared by ECONorthwest for the Great Salt Lake Advisory Council. The economic implications were calculated by assuming a linear relationship between the total economic output of the Great Salt Lake mineral industries and water consumption.
- **Enable Water Banking:** Estimates for water banking savings were found in "Water Banking Can Help Great Salt Lake". In the article, Sarah E. Null lays out three potential levels of water banking, dependent upon the willingness of irrigators to sell excess water. The range of policy investment presented in the slider assumes that every level of water banking is possible. Estimates are limited to Cache County, so the estimated maximum cost and impact of the policy are likely higher then present here. 
- **Buy Water Rights:**  The cost-effectiveness and overall impact of this policy demand more study. Water rights could likely initially be purchased extremely cheaply in areas less suitable for farming. However, as the number of water rights purchased for the lake increases, the cost of the water rights will also increase due to the necessity to buy them from productive water users. Because of this, the supply curve is likely upward sloping and convex. The initial investment is likely significantly more cost-effective than the following investments. The total impact is limited by the number of water rights on the market. For the model, a flat price of \$5,000 per acre-foot is assumed. _This is a guess based on casual browsing of KSL water rights markets._
- **Pay Farmers to Not Grow Alfalfa:** Data for the water consumption of hay within the Great Salt Lake basin was sourced from supplementary table one in "Decline of the world's saline lakes". Data for the economic cost of reducing hay production was sourced from "Agricultural Water Use, Hay, and Utah's Water Future". The report uses a variety of sources to estimate the total economic impact of hay on the Utah economy at \$242 million per year. A linear relationship is assumed between money paid and reductions in hay water usage. 
- Estimates for the cost and savings of **canal piping, irrigation replacement, irrigation scheduling, and turf conversion**  are taken from "Economic Insight from Utah's Water Efficiency Supply Curve". Only data for Northern Utah was used. A linear relationship between the amount invested and the quantity of water saved is assumed.

### About the Predicted Effects

The predicted effects section places emphasis on the monetary costs associated with a drying lake. This is because monetary effects are easy to quantify and are often an effective way to drive change. It is important to note, however, that the consequences of a drying lake extend beyond what a dollar sign can convey. Environmental, spiritual, cultural, and recreational costs, among others, must also be considered when assigning an accurate weight to the risks posed.

- The ski industry is negatively affected by a shrinking lake through two mechanisms. First, reduced lake surface area means a reduced lake effect, resulting in less total snow. Second, an increase in the area of exposed lakebed leads to an increase in the dust carried to mountain snow during windstorms. The dust subsequently increases the snow's rate of solar absorption, significantly speeding the melting process. The estimate for the effect of the lake level on ski season is taken from "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake", which estimates a reduction of \$1.8 million to \$3.0 million if the Great Salt Lake becomes completely dry. To calculate intermediate values,  a linear relationship between lake surface area and spending was assumed. Maximum loss was set at the mean of potential losses present in the report. No losses occur above 4192 ft, as that is the average elevation of the lake when the ECONorthwest study was conducted. The cost equation is$yearly\:cost = \$ 864 * (exposed\:surface\:area – 2795km^2)$, where \$864 is the cost per square kilometer of exposed lakebed below $2795km^2$, and $2795km^2$ is the area exposed in 2019.
- The brine shrimp industry is valued at \$67 million, per the "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake". Less water in the lake leads to increased salinity, harming the growth of algae and brine shrimp. This imperils the brine shrimp fishing industry. However, it is challenging to calculate the effects a reduced water level will have on the industry. Mineral extraction reduces the salinity of the Great Salt Lake, while minerals carried by streams increase the salinity. Because of these factors, the salinity cannot be accurately predicted by only knowing the volume of the lake. In addition, salinity varies between different parts of the lake. Salinity near river inflows is significantly lower than overall salinity, leading to the potential for brine shrimp to survive in a reduced habitat if salinity in other parts of the lake exceeds their limit. Finally, there is a risk of ecosystem collapse above certain salinity levels. Below 4170 ft, the brine shrimp industry is assumed to be nonexistent. Between 1277m and 1271m, the brine shrimp industry is assumed to be harmed by the low water levels. The reduced habitat and increasing risk of ecosystem collapse associated with reduced lake levels is modeled by $yearly\:cost = \$67,000,000 * ({(1277 – elevation)^2 \over 36})$, where elevation is in meters.
- Lower lake levels expose more of the lakebed, increasing the severity of dust storms along the Wasatch Front. The lakebed contains high levels of PM10 particulate matter and a variety of toxic chemicals from industrial and agricultural runoff. In saline lakes that have dried up, dust from the lake bed has been linked to increased rates of asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases. The current healthcare costs of dust exposure for the 2.5 million nearby Wasatch Front residents are estimated to be between \$3.16 million to \$13.56 million. If the lake dries completely, these costs are predicted to jump to between \$6.59 million to \$22.29 million annually. I assume a linear relationship between healthcare costs and exposed lakebed area, with a maximum cost of \$14.44 million, the mean of the range estimated by ECONorthwest. The resulting equation is $yearly\:cost = \$2590 * exposed\:surface\:area, where $exposed\:surface\:area$ is in $km^2$. This estimate assumes that the portion of exposed lakebed that is dust-generating, 11%, remains constant. The remaining 89% of the lakebed is protected from generating dust by a crust. Human activity can break the crust. If the portion of dust-generating lakebed increases over time, this could lead to an up to 10x increase in dust and potential health effects.
- The total economic output of recreational spending at the Great Salt Lake is estimated to be \$160.5 million annually. Lower lake levels can prevent access (such as the Great Salt Lake Marina being dry), eliminate reasons to visit (such as a reduction in the number of migratory birds), or reduce aesthetic reasons for tourism. Recreational costs are modeled with a quadratic form, to mimic the increasing difficulties of water access and the increasing chance of ecosystem collapse and its subsequent tourism effects. There is no recreational spending expected for a dry lake and no effect on recreation above 1278m. Between 1270m and 1278m the costs are modeled by $yearly\:cost = \$160 million * (({1278 – elevation)^2 \over 64})$, where elevation is in meters.
- Additional effects, such as marina closing and West Desert pumping activation, are sourced from the Utah Department of Natural Resources' "Final Great Salt Lake Comprehensive Management Plan and Record of Decision".
- Lake flooding can have significant adverse effects on the lake's ecosystem and the surrounding infrastructure. These effects are not included in the model under the assumption that the West Desert pumps would limit the lake's maximum elevation in the event of high water levels, thus preventing the negative effects of a flooded lake. Because the pumps are still being maintained, this is a reasonable assumption.

### About the Data

Streamflow data into the Great Salt Lake was used to develop the model. Daily inflow data for the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers was gathered from monitors administered by the United States Geographic Survey (USGS). Streamflow data was collected between 1963 and 2022. Data for the Bear River was available at a downstream site between 1971 and 1986, and an upstream site for the entire monitoring period. The period of overlapping data shows that the downstream site had a higher flow rate than the upstream site. This is caused by streams that enter the Bear River between the two sites. Because the goal of the streamflow data is to capture the total water in the lake, the downstream monitoring location is ideal. A linear regression was performed to predict the downstream flow rate based on the upstream flow rate (p < 0.001). The flow rate of the Bear River was measured by the upstream monitor but adjusted based on the results of the regression. According to the article “An Examination of the Sensitivity of the Great Salt Lake to Changes in Inputs”, the Davis River and a handful of other small streams contribute 6% of total streamflow entering the Great Salt Lake. The inflow of these sources was assumed to be linearly correlated with the inflow of the Bear, Weber, and Jordan rivers. Based on this assumption, an additional 'Other Streams' category was added to streamflow, equivalent to (the combined flow of the Bear, Weber, and Jordan rivers * 0.064).

Data for rainfall, groundwater, lake elevation, consumptive use, and the bathymetry of the lake were also used to develop the model. Precipitation and temperature data was retrieved from the PRISM Climate Group based at Oregon State University. PRISM reports monthly weather data on a 4km grid. To calculate average direct precipitation, a set of 24 evenly spaced grid sections over the lake were selected. The weather data from these 24 grid sections were averaged to determine the mean monthly direct precipitation. Weather data was collected between 1900 and 2022. Groundwater inflow was estimated to be $0.093km^3yr^{-1}$, based on the findings in "Water and salt balance of Great Salt Lake, Utah, and simulation of water and salt movement through the causeway". Groundwater flow was assumed to be constant for all years. Lake elevation data was collected from USGS monitoring sites in the South Arm of the lake. Lake elevation data before October 24th, 2022 was collected from the Saltair Boat Harbor station. Data was later collected from the elevation gauge at the south side of the causeway. The Great Salt Lake is divided by a causeway, which has intermediately led to water levels varying between the North and South Arms of the lake. The effect of this was not incorporated into the model. Consumptive water use is defined by the USGS as "the part of water withdrawn that is evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops, consumed by humans or livestock, or otherwise not available for immediate use". Yearly consumptive water use data was sourced from supplementary table 1 in "Decline of the world's saline lakes". Consumptive use data covered the years from 1850 to 2013. Bathymetry (submerged topography) data were downloaded from Biowest and downscaled to a resolution of 100m x 100m in QGIS for easier processing. A table relating elevation, surface area, and volume is used by the model to save computation time. The table was created by calculating the volume of water in every 100m x 100m square. The table has a resolution of 0.01m of elevation. 

Evaporation and streamflow data before human consumption were derived from historical data. Evaporation was calculated by the equation $total\:evaporation = \Delta volume\:– \int inflow$,  with the evaporation constant measured by $k$ being defined by $k = {total\:evaporation \over mean\:surface\:area}$ and measured in units $km^3km^{-2}yr^{-1}$.  Streamflow data before human consumption was determined by adding the amount of water consumed by humans upstream from the lake (excluding water used in mineral extraction) to the amount of water that enters the lake through streamflow.

Yearly averages were calculated for use in the model. Yearly pre-consumption streamflow was averaged from 1964 to 2022. Climate data were averaged from 1895 to 2022. Consumptive use data was averaged from 2003 to 2013. The consumptive use date range was chosen as a balance between using the most up-to-date data available (2013 is the most recently available data) and using a sample size large enough to smooth year-to-year inconsistencies.

### About the Model

The model uses a mass balance approach to determine a long-run average lake level. First, yearly averages for streamflow, temperature, precipitation, and rate of consumption are adjusted by the user. User-selected policies determine the level of water consumption for different subcategories. Total water consumption is then subtracted from the average streamflow prior to human consumption, which determines a new yearly average for the volume of water that reaches the lake through rivers and streams. 

Temperature affects the rate of evaporation. In addition to directly changing the rate of evaporation, yearly temperature is used as a proxy for other climatic conditions (such as hours of sunlight and dew point) that affect the rate of evaporation. The effect of temperature was determined by running a linear regression on the rate of evaporation against the average yearly temperature. The regression was run on the years 1964 through 2013, based on the availability of streamflow and water consumption data. The years 1987-1992 were excluded from the analysis because the effects of the West Desert Pumping Project (1987) and its subsequent backflow into the lake (1988-1992) are not accounted for. The regression returned the equation $k = 0.000100 * (\Delta C^{\circ}) + 0.00075$ , with a p-value of 0.05 and an $R^2$ of 0.334. By default, the model uses a temperature of $11.67C^{\circ}$, equivalent to the average temperature from 2017 through 2022. 

After setting constants based on the users selection, the model repeats the following steps every year:

1. First, the lake's volume and surface area are determined from the elevation using bathymetry data.
2. Next, the change in lake volume is calculated. The water volume lost to evaporation is calculated by multiplying the lake's surface area with the evaporation rate. The water volume gained from rain is calculated by multiplying the average rate of rainfall by the lake's surface area. Water volume from groundwater is added. Water volume from streamflow for the month, after being adjusted for consumption, is added.
3. Finally, a new elevation is calculated based on the adjusted water volume.

This cycle is repeated every year for the selected prediction window. Given a long enough window, the model will always reach a predicted elevation that does not vary year-to-year.

The model does not incorporate population change in the prediction. This is because population growth has not had a perceptible effect on water consumption over the last forty years. This effect is likely due to the high rate of water consumption for agricultural purposes when compared to industrial and municipal uses. As the population along the Wasatch Front increases, farmland is replaced with pavement and the net water usage is not affected. See the Q&As section for more details.
