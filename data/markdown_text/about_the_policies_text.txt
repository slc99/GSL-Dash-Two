**About the Policies**

It is hard to determine the effects of a policy before it is implemented. For this tool, I used a variety of published predictions. Details for each policy are below:

- **Pause New Water Rights Applications:** Predicted effects are based on the estimates found in the Salt Lake Tribune article "Gov. Cox put new water rights on hold. Will it actually help the Great Salt Lake?", which states that "the Division of Water Rights has only approved about 4,000 acre-feet of new diversions in the Great Salt Lake basin over the last five years". This effect is extrapolated for 30 years, assuming 100% consumption. This method overestimates the effects of the policy.
- **Install Secondary Meters:** Water saved per connection was calculated from a sample of 5,000 Uintah Bench residents based on "Secondary Metering White Paper 2022-02-14". Total savings were calculated by multiplying per household savings with the estimated 221,000 unmetered connections targeted by HB242. The cost of the policy, $250 million, was set by the funds allocated in HB242. This likely overestimates the effect of the policy because a portion of the unmetered connections are outside the Great Salt Lake basin, However, future water price increases may further reduce the water consumption of metered connections, so the total effect is hard to quantify.
- **Limit Mineral Water Usage:** Total water consumption of US Magnesium and other mineral companies was found from data published in "Decline of the world's saline lakes". Estimates for the total economic output of mineral industries were found in "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake" prepared by ECONorthwest for the Great Salt Lake Advisory Council. The economic implications were calculated by assuming a linear relationship between the total economic output of the Great Salt Lake mineral industries and water consumption.
- **Enable Water Banking:** Estimates for water banking savings were found in "Water Banking Can Help Great Salt Lake". In the article, Sarah E. Null lays out three potential levels of water banking, dependent upon the willingness of irrigators to sell excess water. The range of policy investment presented in the slider assumes every level of water banking is possible. Estimates are limited to Cache County, so the estimated maximum cost and impact of the policy are likely higher.
- **Buy Water Rights:**  The cost-effectiveness and overall impact of this policy demand more study. Water rights could likely initially be purchased extremely cheaply in areas less suitable for farming. However, as the number of water rights purchased for the lake increases, the cost of the water rights will also increase due to the necessity to buy them from farmers and other productive water users. Because of this, the supply curve is likely upward sloping and convex. The initial investment is likely significantly more cost-effective than the following investments. The total impact is limited by the number of water rights on the market. For the model, a flat price of $5,000 per acre-foot is assumed. _This is a guess based on casual browsing of KSL water rights markets._
- **Pay Farmers to Not Grow Alfalfa:** Data for the water consumption of hay is found in supplementary table one in "Decline of the world's saline lakes". Data for the economic impact is sourced from the "Agricultural Water Use, Hay, and Utah's Water Future", which uses a variety of sources to estimate the total economic impact of hay on the Utah economy at $242 million per year. A linear relationship is assumed between money paid and reductions in hay water usage. While a significant portion of Utah hay is used by the Utah cattle industry, approximately a third is exported to foreign countries.
- Estimates for the cost and savings of **canal piping, irrigation replacement, irrigation scheduling, and turf conversion**  are taken from "Economic Insight from Utah's Water Efficiency Supply Curve". Only data for Northern Utah was used. A linear relationship between the amount invested and the quantity of water saved is assumed.
