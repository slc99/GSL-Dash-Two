## About the Predicted Effects

The predicted effects section places emphasis on the monetary costs associated with a drying lake. This is because monetary effects are easy to quantify and are often an effective way to drive change. It is important to note, however, that the consequences of a drying lake extend beyond what a dollar sign can convey. Environmental, spiritual, cultural, and recreational costs, among others, must also be considered when assigning an accurate weight to the risks posed.

- The ski industry is negatively affected by a shrinking lake through two mechanisms. First, reduced lake surface area means a reduced lake effect, resulting in less total snow. Second, an increase in the area of exposed lakebed leads to an increase in the dust carried to mountain snow during windstorms. The dust subsequently increases the snow's rate of solar absorption and significantly speeds the melting process. The estimate for the effect of the lake level on ski season is taken from "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake", which estimates a reduction of $1.8 million to $3.0 million if the Great Salt Lake becomes completely dry. To calculate intermediate values, I assumed a linear relationship between lake surface area and spending. A maximum loss of $2.4 million was set as a mean of potential losses. No losses occur above 4192 ft, as that is the average elevation of the lake when the ECONorthwest study was conducted. The cost equation is yearly cost = $864 \* (exposed\_surface\_area – 2795km2), where $864 is the cost per square kilometer of exposed lakebed below 2795km2, and 2795km is the area exposed in 2019.
- The brine shrimp industry is valued at $67 million, per "Assessment of Potential Costs of Declining Water Levels in Great Salt Lake". Less water in the lake leads to increased salinity, harming the growth of algae and brine shrimp. This imperils the brine shrimp fishing industry. However, it is challenging to calculate the effects a reduced water level will have on the industry. Mineral extraction reduces the salinity of the Great Salt Lake, while minerals carried by streams increase the salinity. Because of these factors, the salinity cannot be accurately predicted by only knowing the volume of the lake. In addition, salinity varies between different parts of the lake. Salinity near river inflows is significantly lower than overall salinity, leading to the potential for brine shrimp to survive in a reduced habitat if salinity exceeds their maximum. Finally, there is a risk of complete ecosystem collapse above certain salinity levels. Below 4170 ft, the brine shrimp industry is assumed to be nonexistent. Between 1277m and 1271m the reduced habitat and increasing risk of ecosystem collapse associated with reduced lake levels, is modeled by yearly cost = $67,000,000 \* ((1277 – elevation)2 / 36), where elevation is in meters.
- Lower lake levels expose more of the lakebed, increasing the severity of dust storms along the Wasatch Front. The lakebed contains high levels of PM10 particulate matter and a variety of toxic chemicals from industrial and agricultural runoff. In saline lakes that have dried up, dust from the lake bed has been linked to increased rates of asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases. The current healthcare costs of dust exposure for the 2.5 million nearby Wasatch Front residents are estimated to be between $3.16 million to $13.56 million. If the lake dries completely, these costs are predicted to jump to between $6.59 million to $22.29 million annually. I assume a linear relationship between healthcare costs and exposed lakebed area, with a maximum cost of $14.44 million, or the mean of the range estimated by ECONorthwest. The resulting equation is yearly cost = $2590 \* exposed\_surface\_area, where exposed\_surface\_area is in km2. This estimate assumes that the portion of exposed lakebed that is dust-generating, 11%, remains constant. The remaining 89% of the lakebed is protected by a crust. Human activity can break the crust. If the portion of dust-generating lakebed increases over time, this could lead to a maximum 10x increase in dust and potential health effects.
- The total economic output of recreational spending at the Great Salt Lake is estimated to be $160.5 million annually. Lower lake levels can prevent access (such as the Great Salt Lake Marina being dry), eliminate reasons to visit (such as a reduction in the number of migratory birds), or reduce aesthetic reasons for tourism. Recreational costs are modeled with a quadratic form, to mimic the increasing difficulties of water access and the increasing chance of ecosystem collapse and its subsequent tourism effects. There is no recreational spending expected for a dry lake and no effect on recreation above 1278m. Between 1270m and 1278m the costs are modeled by yearly cost = $160 million \* ((1278 – elevation)2 / 64).
- Additional effects, such as marina closing and West Desert pumping activation, are sourced from the Utah Department of Natural Resources' "Final Great Salt Lake Comprehensive Management Plan and Record of Decision".
- Lake flooding can have significant adverse effects on the lake's ecosystem and the surrounding infrastructure. These effects are not included in the model under the assumption that the West Desert pumps would limit the lake's maximum elevation, thus preventing the negative effects of a flooded lake.
